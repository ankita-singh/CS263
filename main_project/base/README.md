#SPORTIFY
=============================


##Problem:
One of the major reasons behind the sedentary lifestyle these days is that everyone is soo busy that it becomes a challenge to connect with the right team players. People in the same circle not always share the same interests. Joining sports clubs are helpful but they are often restrictive in time and not a very convenient option.

This application tries to provide a solution to these problems. The main idea is to help users adapt to a healthier lifestyle by peer to peer motivation. 

=============================

##Solution:
This is an interest and time availability based application, which aims to tackle the above mentioned problem. The application provides a platform wherein people can add a sport to their interest and the time in which they are free. Depending upon the popularity of that recreation event, users can also create teams. This application provides a platform for sports enthusiasts to collaborate and schedule various Sports/recreational events. 

=============================

##Design and Plan
The plan is to include the basic functionalities initially and update it gradually. A user can add a particular sport/activity to the wall/calendar, based upon the time constraints ,weather conditions and personal inclinations. Other users can join him or create new events.
